    We led a strategic desgin-team for a national workforce development effort
    of 60+ private sector partners. The team created a framework to improve
    programmatic design, practice, and evaluation for organizations and funders
    targeting often excluded populations, such as people earning low wages with
    an associateâ€™s degree or less and opportunity youth.
