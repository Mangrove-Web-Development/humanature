    We worked on a national effort to improve UNCF’s outcomes and initiatives
    targeting vulnerable populations, such as first-generation college students
    and disconnected youth. We enriched UNCF’s understanding of key subject
    areas related to human potential, including how chronic stress and trauma
    relate to productivity, the psychosocial elements of belongingness, and the
    science of learning.
