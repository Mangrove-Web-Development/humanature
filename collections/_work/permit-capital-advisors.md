    We currently consult with PCA to provide a social due diligence process for
    a local impact investing fund with a strong commitment to gender and racial
    equity. We offer strategic advice to the fund and to entrepreneurs seeking
    financial support and provide an analysis on the alignment of the potential
    investmentâ€™s budgets, operations, and mission in the context of their
    desired impact.
