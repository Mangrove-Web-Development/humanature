    We spent three years consulting ownership on how to design a company culture
    that could live up to the B Corpâ€™s social-justice mission as a fair chance
    business. Triple Bottom Brewery is now thriving with a tight-knit group of
    employees that include historically excluded populations impacted by failed
    housing and criminal justice policies. Currently, its workforce is 50
    percent people of color and 50 percent women.
