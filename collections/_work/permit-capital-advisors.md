    We created accountability structures for a social impact fund that had a
    strongly stated commitment to racial and gender equity goals. We held a
    series of conversations with leadership that resulted in changes to how the
    fund deployed analytics-based criteria for performance evaluation and how it
    approached one-to-one comparisons between Black- , brown- , and women-owned
    firms and their peers.
