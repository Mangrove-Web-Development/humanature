    We spent four years in close consultation with ownership over their design
    of a company culture that could live up to the B Corp’s social-justice
    mission as a fair chance business. Triple Bottom Brewery is now thriving
    with a tight-knit group of employees that includes formerly incarcerated and
    formerly homeless individuals. TBB’s workforce is 50 percent people of color
    and 50 percent women within an industry that’s dominated by white men.
