  We facilitated an unprecedented six-month-long professional learning community
  to drive meaningful change in Philadelphia on the topic of race, social
  equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace. What was generated during
  Empathy Lab has since been brought to the local employment ecosystem through
  key stakeholder participants.
