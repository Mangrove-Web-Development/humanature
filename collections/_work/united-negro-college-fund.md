    We worked on a national effort to guide the institution in an initiative
    that had the stated goal of producing better outcomes for vulnerable
    populations (our preferred term is “resilient communities”) such as
    first-generation college students, individuals experiencing homelessness,
    disconnected youth, and adults in the workforce. We deepened UNCF’s
    knowledge in a number of subject areas related to human potential, including
    how chronic stress and trauma relate to productivity; the psychosocial
    elements of belongingness; and how workplaces can take advantage of the
    science of learning.
