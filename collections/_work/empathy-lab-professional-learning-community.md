  We led an unprecedented six-month-long professional learning community in
  Philadelphia that’s driven meaningful change around DEI, REI, and strategic
  human design in the workplace. Our curriculum offered stakeholder
  participants, including some of the region’s leading nonprofit and for-profit
  employers, a chance to collaborate on the future of work in ways that benefit
  the entire employment ecosystem.
