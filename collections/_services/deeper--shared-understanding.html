  We utilize a holistic diagnostic process to first help organizations
  interrogate their current policies and practices, and how they relate to human
  development, meaningful interaction, and performance. From there we offer
  steps to increase capacity and enable cultural change.

    content_text: >-
      Humanature collaborates with clients to establish a baseline understanding
      of the potentially harmful and often invisible underpinnings of an
      organization which can hamper humanity. This scaffolding is used to
      establish solutions that meet stakeholders’ needs. 
  - heading: Mechanics of Our Humanity
    content_text: >-
      We supply our expert curriculum that guides clients through the stages of
      sense-making that push forward their understanding of topics such as human
      ecology, public policy, and narrative intelligence — establishing the core
      of Humanature’s approach.
  - heading: 'Iterative learning '
    content_text: >-
      Humanature's unique experiential learning practice is informed by
      principles borrowed from social science to design practices and tools to
      integrate the skills clients have acquired into their organizational
      structure. 
  - heading: Framing
    content_text: >-
      Humanature collaborates with clients to surface the potentially harmful
      systematic underpinnings of the client or organization  and how that
      presents itself within the context of work they do, the organizational
      culture and the ways in which they seek to meet stakeholders needs
  - heading: Resource & Reference Library
    content_text: >-
      We supplement client learning and shared understanding by offering up
      original, existing and repurposed content and resources. The utilization
      of resources allows for deeper interrogation,  and understanding to
      collaboratively work towards solutions. (May not be able to use this)

    content_text: >-
      Through our expertly crafted and iterative curriculum we present our
      clients with the fundamentals of human development in the context of 
      stress, trauma, and identity based factors. (needs editing)
  - heading: Shared Understanding
    content_text: >-
      Throughout our engagement we carefully define and work under the premise
      of  shared understanding and common language. By doing so it helps us
      collaborate with our clients and create ripe environments for meaningful
      conversations and creative problem solving.
