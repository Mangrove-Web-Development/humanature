  We utilize a holistic diagnostic process to first help organizations
  interrogate their current policies and practices, and how they relate to human
  development, meaningful interaction, and performance. From there we offer
  steps, including professional learning opportunities, to increase capacity and
  enable cultural change.

      Humanature collaborates with clients to establish a baseline understanding
      of the potential challenges and opportunities, often invisible to an
      organization, that can hamper or reinforce the humanity and achievements
      of their team(s). This scaffolding is used to co-design and imagine
      solutions that meet the diverse needs of the organization's stakeholders.
  - heading: 'The Mechanics of Our Humanity '
    content_text: >-
      We supply and customize our expert curriculum that guides clients through
      stages of learning and sense-making that push forward their understanding
      of topics such as the science of learning, performance and skill
      development, and narrative intelligence. Ultimately, we help people
      understand the multidimensional nature of our humanity and its deployment,
      or lack of consideration, in team, project, and work-based settings.
  - heading: 'Iterative learning '
    content_text: >-
      Humanature's unique experiential learning practice is informed by
      principles borrowed from social science to design practices and tools to
      integrate the skills clients have acquired into their organizational
      structure.
