description_text: >-
  We work with clients to create “Humanity R&D Labs” as a fast-paced learning
  and design space that serves as a platform for staff and other key 
  stakeholders to collaboratively explore, strategize, and innovate on what it
  means for them to center shared humanity in the organization’s culture,
  processes, and practices. The labs include:

  - heading: Reimagining Places (Design-Focused Activities)

      We interrogate various person-in-environment contexts such as
      belongingness (maximizing healthy opportunities for individuals), asset
      framing (honoring the strengths of each person), and the science of
      learning (upskilling and reskilling)—plus, how these concepts relate to
      identity-based experiences.  
  - heading: 'Building A Common Lexicon and Knowledge Base (Experiential Learning)  '
    content_text: >-
      We work with teams to help them develop a common grounding in the four
      co-occurring domains of human development, using health sciences,
      indigenous wisdom, and systems-based models. We explore how interwoven our
      humanity is with 21st century concerns of productivity, creativity, skill
      development, expectation management, and envisioning the future. 
  - heading: 'Content/Tool Development '
    content_text: >-
      To keep the work going, we supply organizations with a content library
      that enriches, explores, and reinforces these human-centered approaches
      beyond the setting of a formalized engagement.
