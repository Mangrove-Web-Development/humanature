                </h3>
                <div class="editable col-7-to-12 s-col-1-to-5">
                    <p>Our mission is both simple and complex: we support organizations, leaders, and initiatives to center humanity in the context of their work. Right now, many are forced to center funders, outputs, outcomes, procedures and bureaucracy&hellip;but not the humans impacted by the systems and issues complicating their ability to survive, let alone thrive.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>We imagine a world that supports the whole of humanity and all that it takes to hold up humanity. Our org helps develop and shape some of the processes and tools that will transition us there. We believe in systems of transition that help us practice, iterate, and implement the equity, health, and belongingness the world so desperately needs.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Our solutions draw from tried-and-true methods in the indigenous world along with groundbreaking research in fields like social and cognitive neuroscience, trauma theory, human ecology, organizational behavior, social epidemiology, and the science of learning. We have built a budding practice that supports teams in designing organizational cultures, learning opportunities, and models of practice that foster a culture of learning and compassionate curiosity.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>We believe that equity is a process as much as it&rsquo;s an outcome. So, power-sharing, developing sustainable relationships with diverse communities and stakeholders, and cultivating a sense of shared humanity are all imperative activities for systems of transition.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>At Humanature, we believe that all of this knowledge is paramount to how we, as a world, think about human development, belongingness, and the Future of Society.&nbsp;</p>
