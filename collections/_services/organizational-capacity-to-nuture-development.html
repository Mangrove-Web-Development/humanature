  We deliver frameworks and collective models that endow organizations with
  proven techniques for improving engagement, inclusivity, and productivity. 
details:
  - heading: 'Reimagining Spaces '
    content_text: >-
      We interrogate various person-in-environment contexts such as
      belongingness (maximizing healthy opportunities for individuals), asset
      framing (honoring the strengths of each person), and the science of
      learning (upskilling and reskilling)—plus, how these concepts relate to
      identity-based experiences.
  - heading: 'Workshops '
    content_text: >-
      We educate audiences on the four co-occurring domains of humanity: the
      biological, the psychological, the social, and the spiritual (not to be
      confused with religious), plus how they’re all interwoven and ultimately
      impact productivity.  
  - heading: 'Content/Tool Development '
    content_text: >-
      To keep the work going, we supply organizations with a content library
      that enriches, explores, and reinforces these human-centered approaches
      beyond the setting of a formalized engagement.

      we can begin to shape a holistic view of the interconnectedness between
      policy, "social budgeting", ......
  - heading: Spaces
    content_text: >-
      We help curate spaces through designed learning for our clients and
      stakeholders to hold and work through tensions, conflict, and come up with
      a path towards a solution.
  - heading: Stories & Narratives
    content_text: >-
      Interwoven throughout our engagement with clients, we craft prompts that
      make sense of our clients and stakeholders lived experiences. By
      illuminating stories told by our clients and their stakeholders we can
      further applications of empathy.
  - heading: Shared Humanity
    content_text: >-
      Humanature designs containers to elaborate on common understanding to help
      create a fertile environment to dialogue, work through conflict and
      empathize with the live experiences of various people that make up
      organizations.
